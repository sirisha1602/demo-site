## Overview

* In this document we explore the features of Manifest Based Kubernetes as a Cloud Provider.
* In this deployment Spinnaker Kubernetes Support V2, whereas V1 provider is yet to
compatible here.
* Unlike V1 provider, in V2 the Account doesnâ€™t require any Docker Registry Accounts.
	
## Prerequisites

* Mandatory to have kubeconfig and kubectl for the Spinnaker.
* As Spinnaker relies on kubeconfig for Authentication to the kubernetes cluster to gain
read/write access to all the resources.
* Relies on kubectl to manage all the API access.
* Also, as V1 providers are not supported here, all the V1 related Pipelines to be migrated
from V1 to V2. Refer to this Article for the V1-V2 migration steps
